  "Resumen":"Summary",
  "Summary Winbance": "I am grateful to the Winbance team for the opportunity to work together. I feel like I have connected with good business allies. In this project, there were significant challenges to face, such as developing different landing pages to attract clients, a platform to manage subscriptions, and a dashboard connected to various APIs. As a full-stack developer accustomed to building projects from scratch, I can say that at Winbance, I learned to value WordPress to launch an MVP.",
  "Summary Impetum": "Impetum is a real estate company that occasionally requires my services to provide brief support to their property platform. Although I didn't develop the project, we have had a continuous relationship for 2 years, and I am happy with the contribution I make whenever they require my services.",
  "Summary Olympiac": "I worked as a PM directing integrations to the platform for managing multiple gyms. In this project, I developed various extensions to the platform with my team, such as an application to allow access to gyms through QR code reading, a calendar managing different exercise plans for trainers and users of each gym, among others. Currently, I support the Olympiac team in acquiring new talents, although I am not actively working on the project.",
  "Summary ACI Consulting": "I worked as a PM managing the Front End development of 3 projects related to electronic billing and ERP for food control for the Jewish community in the United States. I don't speak English, but with the help of a colleague and the willingness of all parties, we managed to work for two consecutive years. Currently, I stay in touch with the people I worked with on these projects.",
  "Summary Mis Ganancias": "I worked as a WM providing support to the extensive server of Mis Ganancias, where I also carried out over 500 installations of the ERP currently owned by this company. Additionally, on different occasions, we integrated new modules, such as the billing module for Guatemala. I still keep in touch with the owner of this company whenever my services are required.",
  "Summary BeePro": "In this project, I faced different challenges, such as acquiring new talents, as it was very difficult to integrate new programmers due to the project's many extensions in different languages and the lack of clear documentation at the time. Additionally, the database contains highly confidential information. So, together, we started working on the infrastructure, managing to integrate tools to manage servers, such as Forge Laravel. We increased the site's security, cleaned up the repositories, and created an isolated database, making it much easier to integrate new staff quickly and efficiently.",
  "Summary Core Medical": "I worked on building the online store for this wonderful company where I built very good friendships that I still maintain. Along the way, we faced different challenges such as creating different landing pages for advertising campaigns and managing a wide variety of products. I am grateful for the opportunity they gave me and the friendships I gained.",
  "Summary Nunez de Arenas": "I worked on building the ecommerce platform during the digital transformation of this amazing company. I remember being quite young when we met, and they already had about 20 stores in Madrid, with the goal of reaching 42 stores. While I worked on the online store, I learned many things and faced fun challenges like creating a module that would detect your size by simply entering your weight and height. I still maintain a good relationship with the Nu√±ez de Arenas team and am grateful for the special opportunity they gave me.",
  "Summary TSJ": "I have been working since I was 17, but this was the first legal job I had üòÖ. I come from a family of lawyers, so I gave myself the opportunity to get to know this world more closely, without leaving aside my passion for technology. So, I worked as a coordinator of a single agenda and developed my own system to assign dates based on certain legal requirements that must be met to bring together all parties involved in a trial, such as a Judge, Defendant, Defender, Prosecutor, among others. I made very good friends with whom I still converse; some are part of my team, and I am happy with everything I learned in this job.",

  "Goal-Descrption": "I want to build my first SaaS, and for that, I'm expanding my network of contacts. Let's do something together!",
  "Community service description 1": "I'm developing",
  "Community service description 2": "a place where we gather job offers to help others find more and better employment opportunities. My goal is to create a community of freelancers where we can all grow together.",
  "Hobbies description": "I'm building my farm, I love the countryside, the outdoors, the smell of cows, and playing around with the solar panels I just bought ü´¢. Sorry, I just didn't have anyone else to tell. üòÖ",
